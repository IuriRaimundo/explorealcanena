# Explore Alcanena

[Deployed application](https://explorealcanena.web.app/)

**Explore Alcanena** was my final project for the multimedia technician course. The project consisted of creating a web application to help visitors on their visit to Alcanena.

This was my first experience in developing an application, and also my first experience with the technologies mentioned below, with the exception of JavaScript and CSS, which I had used previously in small projects.

This project won **3rd place in the Software category** in the [2021 PAPTICE competition](https://anpri.pt/pap/2021/07/23/premiados-no-concurso-paptice-2021/).
